## Usage Instructions

### Adding New Videos

1. **Upload the Video**: Place the new video in the appropriate folder based on its category (e.g., sermons, events, activities).
2. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive and consistent naming for the videos. For example, `sermon1.mp4` for sermon recordings, `event1.mp4` for event videos.
3. **Referencing Videos in HTML/CSS**:
    - Example for HTML: 
    ```html
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
      <source src="videos/sermons/sermon1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    ```
    - Example for Embedding Videos from External Sources:
    ```html
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/your-video-id" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    ```

### Recommended Video Formats and Resolutions

- **Video Format**: MP4 is recommended for its wide compatibility.
- **Resolution**: 720p (1280x720) or 1080p (1920x1080) for high-quality viewing.

Ensure videos are optimized for web use to maintain fast loading times.

## Additional Notes

- **Video Optimization**: Use tools like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to compress videos without losing quality.
- **Video Credits**: If any videos are sourced externally, make sure to provide proper credits and ensure you have the right to use them.
